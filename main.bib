  abstract     = {The boxdot conjecture asserts that every normal modal logic that faithfully interprets T by the well-known boxdot translation is in fact included in T. We conﬁrm that the conjecture is true. More generally, we present a simple semantic condition on modal logics L0 which ensures that the largest logic where L0 embeds faithfully by the boxdot translation is L0 itself. In particular, this natural generalization of the boxdot conjecture holds for S4, S5, and {KTB} in place of T.},

  abstract  = {This book, written by one of the most distinguished of contemporary philosophers of mathematics, is a fully rewritten and updated successor to the author's earlier The Unprovability of Consistency (1979). Its subject is the relation between provability and modal logic, a branch of logic invented by Aristotle but much disparaged by philosophers and virtually ignored by mathematicians. Here it receives its first scientific application since its invention. Modal logic is concerned with the notions of necessity and possibility. What George Boolos does is to show how the concepts, techniques, and methods of modal logic shed brilliant light on the most important logical discovery of the twentieth century: the incompleteness theorems of Kurt Godel and the 'self-referential' sentences constructed in their proof. The book explores the effects of reinterpreting the notions of necessity and possibility to mean provability and consistency.},

We shall be concerned mostly with the Lewis system and the Heyting system. Some of the results here are new (in particular, Theorems 2.4, 3.1, 3.9, 3.10, 4.5, and 4.6); others have been stated without proof in the literature (in particular, Theorems 2.1, 2.2, 4.4, 5.2, and 5.3).The proofs to be given here will be found to be mostly very simple; generally speaking, they amount to drawing conclusions from the theorems established in {McKinsey} and Tarski [10] and [11]. We have thought it might be worth while, however, to publish these rather elementary consequences of our previous work—so as to make them readily available to those whose main interest lies in sentential calculus rather than in topology or algebra.},
