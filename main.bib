  abstract     = {We consider interpretations of modal logic in Peano arithmetic (P) determined by an assignment of a sentence v* of P to each propositional variable v. We put ( l ) * = "0 = 1", (X {\textasciitilde} {tO})* = "X * -'-* q'*" and let (F-1â€¢ be a formalization of "X* is a theorem of P " . We say that a modal formula, X, is valid if X * is a theorem of P in each such interpretation. We provide an axiomitization of the class of valid formulae and prove that this class is recursive.},
